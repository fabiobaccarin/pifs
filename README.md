[Data](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction)

This project analyzes how permutation importance can be useful for selecting
variables in a way starts from the analysis' context rather than from technical
considerations. It stresses how selecting features is important and can be
criticall in the presence of multicollinearity. Also, it discusses a way to use
hierarchical clustering to understand high dimensional datasets with
multicollinear features.
